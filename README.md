# Theme
The theme uses a lego theme, pulling #lego from twitter and lego images from getty images.

# About
This is a project for CST-438 for CSUMB, and uses twitter and getty REST api's for the content.
I simply had to use the same hashtag I used on twitter for the getty image search, being 'lego'.

# Problems
No known problems.

# How to Improve Readme
Use more syntax for lists or images.
